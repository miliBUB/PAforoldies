This project was developed to discover whether or not it was possible to enhance ChatGPT to do more than text-to-text. 

We employed a module called langchain, which was used to link certain actions with GPT, making it able to read and write to a calendar and help manage medication for people with chronic diseases.
At the time of this project, chatGPT did not have this functionality, and therefore it was exciting to see if this was possible to do.
